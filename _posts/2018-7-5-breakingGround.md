At the beginning of anything there are always many obstacles to overcome. In relationships, it comes in the form of meeting parents, trying to find time in busy schedules, and realizing that you don't have as much money as you thought you did. For an organization like Computer Science + Social Good, it comes in the form of recruiting members who care about social good, getting people to come to meetings and trying to find projects that everyone cares about enough to make them come to life. Needless to say, there are a lot of moving pieces.

When trying to think of a good picture to go with this article, I decided to use a rocket ship. I imagine that working at a young organization or a start up feels a lot like launching a rocket. After months of work and thousands of hours put into a project, it comes time to launch it. Within seconds, the whole thing could be destroyed or completely fail its mission. However, just like with a rocket, young organizations have to put in the effort and time to nurture and ensure the success of their product. At CS+SG that's what we are trying to do--to create something that people will use and can take with them into the rest of their lives so they too can teach others. We are trying to teach men to fish rather than feeding them a meal.

So as we go forward in this journey, we ask you all for a few things: patience, passion, a desire to learn, and your honesty. We want to give you all the tools you need, but it's a partnership that we're forming and both parties need to be equally present. There are going to be bumps along the way and many days of frustration for our members, but that means that we care and we want to do better. So please, stick with us and hopefully we'll launch into the future with nothing but possibility around us.

Welcome to Computer Science + Social Good.
